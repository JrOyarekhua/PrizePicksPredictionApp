🏀 PrizePicks NBA Stat Prediction App
📌 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning-powered web application that helps users make more informed picks on PrizePicks by predicting how likely a player is to go over or under a given stat line (e.g., points, rebounds, assists). The app will combine data science, sports analytics, and full-stack development to deliver a useful and intuitive tool.

🎯 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP will focus on delivering a usable prototype with basic prediction functionality. It includes:

📊 Data & Feature Pipeline
Pull NBA player and team stats via the nba_api

Store and organize data (initially local, scalable to a database)

Perform EDA to validate important features based on domain knowledge and research

Select ~10–16 predictive features related to scoring or other stats

🧠 Machine Learning
Train a simple classification or regression model:

Regression for predicting player stat output (e.g., 24.5 points)

Classification for over/under line predictions

Base model could be Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost

Save trained model with evaluation metrics

🖥️ Backend
Build a FastAPI or Flask API to:

Accept player + opponent info

Return a predicted stat line or over/under probability

Manage endpoints like /predict, /players, etc.

🌐 Frontend
Simple UI in React or Next.js that:

Lets users input/select a player and stat line

Shows the model’s predicted outcome (e.g., "65% chance OVER 24.5 points")

Optionally, display supporting stats (e.g., last 5 games, opponent defense rank)

📚 Documentation & Structure
Document assumptions and feature logic

Clear file structure for data, models, backend, and frontend

GitHub-ready with updated README and setup instructions
